<p align="center">Check  List before Handing in Your Thesis</p>
<ol>
  <li>Follow the parts in the <a href="https://zhouchenlin.github.io/Check%20List%20before%20Handing%20in%20Your%20Paper.htm">Check  List before Handing in Your Papers</a> that fits for a Chinese thesis.</li>
  <li>Reduce the use of English as  much as possible, unless the terminology is a well-accepted acronym. You may  write Chinese first and explain it right after it in English when the  terminology first appears. For example, &ldquo;主成分分析（Principal  Component Analysis, PCA）&rdquo;. Note that reduce English not only in body texts, but also in  figures and tables.</li>
  <li>Each math equation should end  with either comma or period (in English style), depending whether the sentence  ends there. If the content right following the math equation is to continue the  sentence, it must not start a paragraph, i.e., there must not be indention at  the beginning of the content.</li>
  <li>For brackets and norms in math  expressions, $\left$ and $\right$ should be used in order to enclose the math  expression in between.</li>
  <li>The reference to equation  number should include parentheses, e.g., &ldquo;(2.1)&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;2.1&rdquo;.</li>
  <li>The inline math symbols and  expressions must be in math mode, such as &ldquo;<em>m</em>, <em>n</em>&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;m, n&rdquo;. Also note that  the negative sign should also be in math mode and the multiplication sign  should be $\times$.</li>
  <li>Math functions should not be in  the italic style, e.g. &ldquo;sin&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;<em>sin</em>&rdquo;.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to the style of  punctuations. Except in equations, the punctuations must be 全角. Moreover,  pay special attention to the correct use of 顿号, which is for  enumeration and is often mistakenly written as 逗号.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the figures are  of high visual quality. Typically they should be in vector mode rather image  mode, unless the figures are pure images. To achieve this, you should output  the figure in EPS or PDF (if you generate them by your own), or use Foxit to  extract the figures and save them in PDF directly (if you adapt for other  papers). </li>
  <li>When referring to figures and  tables, always use figure or table number, rather than &ldquo;如下图&rdquo;. This is  because the position of figures and tables may not be right below the text.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the style of  references is consistent, e.g., names of authors and publications,  capitalization, publication information.</li>
  <li>Cite frequently.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to the extra  vertical spaces and try to reduce them to normal distance.</li>
  <li>There should be space before  parentheses.</li>
  <li>Remove all possible typos and grammatical  errors.</li>
